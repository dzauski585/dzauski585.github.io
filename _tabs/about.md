I am a CRNA who works in Upstate New York. I love teaching and find it difficult to share resources and finally found a way to simplify that process. I enjoy open and closed/structural heart anesthesia. I currently work in private practice but have spent  some time in academics. When I am not at work my wife and I are frequently hiking in the northeastern mountains and are working on our Northeast 111 high peaks.  
  
My wife is an avid photographer and if you are every in need of her services check our her website and portfolio. You can also check out her instagram.

My other hobbies include astronomy/astrophotography and you will find some posts here and there. My current set up is an 8in dobsonian with a ZWO ASI224MC color planetary camera.  
  
Finally as this website is evidence I enjoy computer science and coding. My focus is in python with a special interest in machine learning and AI. I enjoy applying computer science solutions to health care or astronomy problems. Most of these solutions deal with big data or little data depending on your definition. Some of my models and projects are on display here. Check out my github for more projects and detailed readmes.
