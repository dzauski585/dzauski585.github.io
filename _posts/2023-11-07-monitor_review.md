## Auto BP Cuff 

- There are many types of algorithms that go into generating the numbers seen on the screen. All of them use oscillations and plot a curve/give values.

> General guideline is no more than 20-30% drop in MAP from baseline
{: .prompt-info}

> Sitting Position: BP decreases by 0.74mmHg per cm
{: .prompt-danger }

## CVP

![cvp](/assets/img/cvp.png)

- Loss of a Wave: 
  - A fib or V pacing without atrial contraction
- Large a Wave: 
  - Atria emptying against high resistance
  - Tricuspid stenosis, diastolic dysfx, ischemic heart, RVH, AV dissociation, junctional, V paced, PVC
- Large v Wave:
  - Tricuspid regurg

## EKG

## PA Catheter

### When PAOP Does NOT Predict LVEDV

- Overestimates
  - Impaired LV compliance ie. ischemia
  - Mitral valve disease
  - Left to right cardiac shunt
  - Tachycardia
  - PPV
  - PEEP
  - COPD
  - Pulmonary hypertension
  - Non west zone III placement of PAC
- Underestimates
  - Aortic insufficiency

## Pulse Oximetry and the Beer Lambert Law

Important to note that red wavelength is 600 and infra red is 900. The Beer Lambert law discusses absorption of light and then a converstion into a saturation percentage.

- Variables:
  - A = absorbance
  - &epsilon; = molar absorptive coefficient
  - C = concentration (moles/liter)
  - L = length of light path
  - $I_o$ = Incident light
  - I = Transmitted light

$$
{A} = {\varepsilon C l} = {log{({I_o \over I})}}
$$
