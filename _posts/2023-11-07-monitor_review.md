## Auto BP Cuff 

- There are many types of algorithms that go into generating the numbers seen on the screen. All of them use oscillations and plot a curve/give values.

> General guideline is no more than 20-30% drop in MAP from baseline
{: .prompt-info}

> Sitting Position: BP decreases by 0.74mmHg per cm
{: .prompt-danger }

## Pulse Oximetry and the Beer Lambert Law

Important to note that red wavelength is 600 and infra red is 900. The Beer Lambert law discusses absorption of light and then a converstion into a saturation percentage.

- Variables:
  - A = absorbance
  - &epsilon; = molar absorptive coefficient
  - C = concentration (moles/liter)
  - L = length of light path
  - $I_o$ = Incident light
  - I = Transmitted light

$$
{A} = {\varepsilon C l} = {log{({I_o \over I})}}
$$
