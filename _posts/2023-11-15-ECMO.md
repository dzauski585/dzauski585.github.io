## ECMO Circuit Review

### VV ECMO

Most common for lung issues such as ARDS

### VA ECMO

Heart failure, cardiogenic shock, PE. Need to worry about North South syndrome. North being deoxygenated, and South being oxygenated. Also may lead to LV distension in poor outflow states consider VAV or impella or both.

### VVA ECMO

VA ecmo with increased drainage may help offload LV distension

### VAV ECMO

Combined VV and VA support. May need impella for LV distension

## ECMO with LV Impella ie ECPELLA

From the pdf:  

VENOARTERIAL EXTRACORPOREAL MEMBRANE
OXYGENATION (VA-ECMO) commonly is used to support
patients with refractory cardiac arrest or cardiogenic shock
mainly via percutaneous cannulation.4 This strategy may cause
left ventricle (LV) distention that compromises myocardial
recovery. Direct LV unloading provided by Impella was associated
with lower mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock
supported with VA-ECMO in a recent international multicenter
study. The present paper has a specific purpose to provide a complete
overview of this strategy, starting from a solid pathophysiologic
approach. Then, the rationale for unloading the LV and the
related available techniques is discussed. Finally, the combined
configuration of VA-ECMO and Impella (ECPella) is fully
treated, providing its significant clinical applications.
