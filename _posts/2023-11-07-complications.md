## Bone Cement Implantation Syndrome

- Methyl methacrylate cement: increases intramedullary pressure in bones causing micro emboli to be released. They lodge in  lungs causing V/Q mismatch and can cause right heart failure 

- Residual methyl methacrylate in the systemic circulation cases bradycardia, hypotension, and pulmonary HTN, hypoxia, cardiac arrest.

## Post Op Vision Loss

- Central Retinal Artery Occlusion
	- Cardiac bypass
		- Showers of emboli
	- Moss common cause of retinal vision loss after nonocular sx
- Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy
	- Globe pressure on optic disc
- Posterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy
	- Most common adult post op blindness in prone spine sx
	- Theory:
		- Inc intraabdominal pressure, thoracic pressure, JVD, ocular pressure, causes venous congestion and compartment syndrome
	- Risks:
		- Wilson Frame, Obese, male, >50yrs, inc blood loss
	- Treatment
		- Transfuse early, keep MAP  >70 

## Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury TRALI

### Signs and Symptoms

- Rapid onset dyspnea, hypoxia during or within 6 hours of transfusion
- Fever, cyanosis, hypotension
- Non cardiogenic pulmonary edema
- Tx with supportive care

### Physiology

- Priming even such as infection, cytokine administration, surgery, burns that activates pulmonary endothelium
- Infusion of donor derived anti HLA (part of MHC class) or anti HNA antibodies directed against antigens on the neutrophil surface

## Positioning of Hands/Arms

- Palm up or pinky down never palm down
