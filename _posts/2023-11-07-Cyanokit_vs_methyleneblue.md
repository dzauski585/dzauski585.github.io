## Cyanokit (Hydroxocobalamin)

### Dose

- 5g over 15min (full vial) mixed in 200cc NS

### Mechanism

- Nitric oxide scavenger

### General Administration Guide

1. Increase pressers
2. Give dose
3. Watch for large increase in BP and then slowly back off pressors
4. Generally you have one shot to give a single dose...DO Not Waste It!!!

### Side Effects

> Increased Blood Pressure
{: .prompt-info }

- Allergic Reaction
- Acute renal failure with ATN
- Calcium oxylate urine cyrstals
- Chromaturia (bright red urine)
- Interference with Hgb, Creatine, Glucose levels on lab draws
- Pulse ox changes
- Red colored skin

## Methylene Blue

- Along with being quite helpful in hypotension methylene blue is also used to treat methemoglobinemia. This condition is the result of Fe2+ of hemoglobin getting oxidized to Fe3+. This significantly reduces the oxygen carrying capacity of hemoglobin. 
- Finally it also has been shown to help in malaria treatment by stopping the immunologically active byproduct production from the Plasmodium species. 

### Dose

- 1mg/kg over 5-30min for methemoglobinemia

- 2mg/kg over 20min of refractory vasoplegia

- 36-72mg/kg over 3 days for Plasmodium treatment

### Mechanism

- Guanylate cyclase inhibitor
- Endothelial nitric oxide synthase enzyme inhibitor
- Inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitor

### Side Effects

> Serotonin Syndrome
{: .prompt-danger }

> Increased Blood Pressure
{: .prompt-info }

- Decreased pulse ox to approx 85%
- Dark blue/green urine
- Pale skin

## Comparison Between Methylene Blue and Hydroxocobalamin

A small sample size study showed no difference between the two treatment options when faced with vasoplegia status post cardiac bypass.
