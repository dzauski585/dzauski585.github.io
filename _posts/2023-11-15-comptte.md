## TTE Exam

From the pdf:  

Since the first report of the use of ultrasound for cardiovascular diagnosis
by Edler and Hertz1 in 1954, echocardiography has expanded
exponentially over the ensuing decades. The history of echocardiography
is one of continuous innovation. With each discovery of new
technology, the echocardiographic examination has progressively
become longer, more comprehensive, and integrated with more
diverse technology. In some circumstances, refined technology has
completely replaced old methods. In other circumstances, new technology
is incorporated to enhance existing capabilities.
