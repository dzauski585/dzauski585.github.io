This technique allows for the patient to continue to bleed without going into tamponade. The bleeding is sequestered by the pericardial patch and a graft is connected from this resevoir to the right atrium. In time the conduit should clot off. The goal is getting the patient out of the operating room and avoid a bring back. See the paper: [Use of pericardial baffle in the management of intractable bleeding in patients undergoing aortic surgery](https://www.openaccessjournals.com/articles/use-of-pericardial-baffle-in-the-management-of-intractable-bleeding-in-patients-undergoing-aortic-surgery-12908.html#:~:text=Baffle%20technique%20is%20creating%20a,rise%20of%20morbidity%20and%20mortality.)
