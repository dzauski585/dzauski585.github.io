Intractable bleeding can occur in complex
aortic surgeries such as redo aortic surgeries,
aortic dissection repair, endocarditis with root
abscess and aortic arch repairs. The cause of such
bleeding can be multi-factorial, which includes
long bypass time, technique error, coagulopathy,
fragile tissue etc. When common practice
using reinforce sutures, local packing, massive
transfusion of blood and blood products along
with clotting agents fails, a pericardial baffle
(modified Cabrol patch) may be the only option
to save the patient.
