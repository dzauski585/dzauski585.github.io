## Understanding an Echo Report

Check out this great resource [A Practical Approach to Transesophageal Echocardiography](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Approach-Transesophageal-Echocardiography/dp/1496383478)

### Date of Procedure

This should be within one year of surgery.

### Reason for Test

Did the patient status change or is this a normal surveillance echo?

### Image Quality

This is mentioned somehwere in the study. Poor quality images can lead to poor conclusions. If this is a TTE study consider TEE for better images.

### Rate and Rhythm

Dysrhythmias can make LV function analysis both in systole and diastole anomalus. This can also happen with simple brady or tachycardias.

### Chamber Sizes

Check for dilated chambers.

From the pdf:  
    The quantification of cardiac chamber size and function is the cornerstone
    of cardiac imaging, with echocardiography being the most
    commonly used noninvasive modality because of its unique ability
    to provide real-time images of the beating heart, combined with its
    availability and portability. Standardization of the methodology
    used to quantify cardiac chambers is maintained by creating and
    disseminating official recommendations, which when followed by
    practitioners provides uniformity and facilitates communication.

### Hypertrophy

On a simimlar note check for hypertrophy. Remember LV thickness corresponds to LV mass and a 1mm error can through off the LV mass by 15g or more!

### LV Systolic Function

In normal hearts the Teicholz equation is accurate, but for hearts suffering from infaractions past or present the disc method using Simpson's Rule is preferred.

V = LV Volume
D = LV diameter

$$
V = {7D^3 \over 2.4 + D}
$$

### LV Diastolic Function

Grade 1 through 4. Grade 1 is associated with 8x increase in all cause mortality within 5 years!

### RV

Functional status

### Valvular Regurgitation and Stenosis

Measurements and grading will be present. Remember a small yet high velocity jet through a small orifice can appear more severe than a larger slower jet in a larger orifice. Use the PISA (proximal isovelocity surface area) quantification of valvular regurgitation to mitigate this effect.

#### Mitral Stenosis

Valve area by 2d planimetry. 

Pressure half time (PHT) is the time it takes for the pressure gradient across the valve to fall to 50% of its peak.

Equation to link area and PHT:

$$
A = {220 \over PHT}
$$

| Measurement                     | Normal           | Mild      | Moderate | Severe |
| -----------                     | :---------:      | :-------: | :------: | :----: |
| Valve Area ($cm^2$)             |  > 2             | 1.5-2     | 1-135    | < 1    |
| Pressure Half Time (ms)         |                  | < 90      | 90-150   | > 150  |
| Indexed Valve Area $cm^2 / m^2$ | 2                | > 0.85    | 0.6-0.85 | < 0.6  |


#### Aortic Stenosis 

| Measurement                     | Aortic Sclerosis | Mild      | Moderate | Severe |
| -----------                     | :---------:      | :-------: | :------: | :----: |
| Valve Area ($cm^2$)             | 2.6-3.5          | > 1.5     | 1-1.5    | < 1    |
| Mean Gradient (mmHg)            | < 10             | < 20      | 20-40    | > 40   |
| Indexed Valve Area $cm^2 / m^2$ | 2                | > 0.85    | 0.6-0.85 | < 0.6  |
| Peak velocity of flow (m/sec)   | 2.6              | < 2.6-3   | 3-4      | > 4    |

##### Valve Area by Continuity Equation

LVOT = left ventricular outflow tract
AV = aortic valve
VTI = volume time integral foudn with pulse wave doppler in LVOT and continuous wave doppler in the aortic valve. 

$$
{Area_{LVOT} * VTI_{LVOT}} = {Area_{AV} * VTI_{AV}}
$$

The equation is then rearranged to solve for the area of the aortic valve.

If the velocity through the LVOT is faster than 1.5m/s or if the velocity across the aortic valve is less than 3m/s then the pressure gradient should be calculated using the modified Bernoulli equation.

$$
\Delta P = {4(V^2_{AV} - V^2_{LVOT})}
$$

Why the continuity equation and Bernoulli's equation work:

##### Mean Pressure Gradient

Modified Bernoulli's Equation

$$
\Delta P = {4(V^2)}
$$

### Intracardiac Mass

Present or not with sizing and gradients as needed.

### Septal Defects

Present or not with flow direction.

### RV Systolic Pressure

If RV failure is suspected RVSP are often elevated. This is also elevated in obesity, hypertesnion and pulmonary hypertension.

### Pericardium

Effusions if noticed.

### Aorta

Calcifications and sizing.

### Incidental Findings

Any abnormalities including structural defects, pleural effusions etc.

### Summary of Findings

Usually near the beginning or the end and can be useful but be sure to read the corresponding sections for the details.
