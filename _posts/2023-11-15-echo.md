## Understanding an Echo Report

Check out this great resource [A Practical Approach to Transesophageal Echocardiography](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Approach-Transesophageal-Echocardiography/dp/1496383478)

### Date of Procedure

This should be within one year of surgery.

### Reason for Test

Did the patient status change or is this a normal surveillance echo?

### Image Quality

This is mentioned somehwere in the study. Poor quality images can lead to poor conclusions. If this is a TTE study consider TEE for better images.

### Rate and Rhythm

Dysrhythmias can make LV function analysis both in systole and diastole anomalus. This can also happen with simple brady or tachycardias.

### Chamber Sizes

Check for dilated chambers.

From the pdf:  
    The quantification of cardiac chamber size and function is the cornerstone
    of cardiac imaging, with echocardiography being the most
    commonly used noninvasive modality because of its unique ability
    to provide real-time images of the beating heart, combined with its
    availability and portability. Standardization of the methodology
    used to quantify cardiac chambers is maintained by creating and
    disseminating official recommendations, which when followed by
    practitioners provides uniformity and facilitates communication.

### Hypertrophy

On a simimlar note check for hypertrophy. Remember LV thickness corresponds to LV mass and a 1mm error can through off the LV mass by 15g or more!

### LV Systolic Function

Look for additional notes about systolic function whether its in terms of a percentage or in terms of different parts of the heart are akinetic or hypokinetic. Simnpson's is the most common method.

### LV Diastolic Function

Using Doppler to diagnosis heart failure with preserved ejection fraction requires PW Doppler at the mitral annulus and/or tissue Doppler at the medial mitral annulus. The ratios and velocities are then used to extrapolate diastolic dysfunction.

Grade 1 through 4. Grade 1 is associated with 8x increase in all cause mortality within 5 years!

> If e' is < 7 (MV tissue doppler), or the E/e' is more than 8, or if the E:A ratio is more than 2:1 there is diastolic dysfunction

### RV

Functional status usually in terms of a percentage.

### Valvular Regurgitation and Stenosis

Measurements and grading will be present. Remember a small yet high velocity jet through a small orifice can appear more severe than a larger slower jet in a larger orifice. Use the PISA (proximal isovelocity surface area) quantification of valvular regurgitation to mitigate this effect.

### Intracardiac Mass

Present or not with sizing and gradients as needed.

### Septal Defects

Present or not with flow direction.

### RV Systolic Pressure

If RV failure is suspected RVSP are often elevated. This is also elevated in obesity, hypertesnion and pulmonary hypertension.

### Pericardium

Effusions if noticed.

### Aorta

Calcifications and sizing.

### Incidental Findings

Any abnormalities including structural defects, pleural effusions etc.

### Summary of Findings

Usually near the beginning or the end and can be useful but be sure to read the corresponding sections for the details.
