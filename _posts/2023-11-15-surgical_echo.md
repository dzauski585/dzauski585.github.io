## TEE in the OR

From the pdf:  
  
Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a standard
diagnostic and monitoring tool employed in the management of patients
undergoing an entire spectrum of cardiac surgical procedures,
ranging from surgical coronary revascularization to complex valve
repair, combined procedures, and organ transplantation.1
The operating room is a dynamic environment with unique challenges.
Combinations of echocardiographic modalities, including twodimensional
(2D), three-dimensional (3D), color flow and/or spectral
Doppler, and cardiac mechanics, are used to (1) confirm the preoperative
diagnosis, (2) evaluate interval changes, (3) guide surgical interventions
and hemodynamic management, (4) assess results of the surgical
procedure, and (5) diagnose the etiology of hemodynamic disturbances.
Hemodynamic fluctuations, electrical pacing, positive pressure ventilation,
fluid shifts, and surgical maneuvers can impact echocardiographic
evaluation. Frequently, despite interruptions and stressors, decisions
may have to bemade urgently depending on patient and surgical factors.
While a complete echocardiographic evaluation is always recommended
and desirable, itmaynot always bepossible due to the urgency of theprocedure,
competing clinical tasks, or surgical maneuvers
