The ultasound sound image depth represents a side of a triangle represented by the varialbe A.  If you start your needle insertion a distance of Acm from the probe and insert at a 45 degree angle your tip will be in plane at the depth of Acm. A triangle illustrates this below. If you want to see your needle tip before the center or the superior edge of a vascular structure start your puncture closer to the probe.
