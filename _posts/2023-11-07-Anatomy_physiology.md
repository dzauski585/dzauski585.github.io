## Alpha 1 Antitrypsin Deficiency

- Made in liver and stops enzyme alveolar elastase 
- Deficiency causes destruction of pulmonary connective tissue resulting in panlobular  emphysema

## Anticholinergic / Cholinergic Syndromes

### Anticholinergic

- Antimuscarinic use (scopolamine)
- Minimal temp inc, dry mouth, delirium, dry skin, midriasis
- Tx: Physostigmine (only one that can cross BBB)

### Cholinergic

- Organophosphates, nerve agents, nicotine poisoning, cholinesterase inhibitor OD (myasthenia pts)
- Tx: Antimuscarininc drugs such as atropine, if resp compromise intubate and wait for acetylcholine level to come down (no way to reverse nicotinic receptor issue)

## Autonomic Hyperreflexia

- Stimulation of sympathetic nervous system below level of spinal cord injury (bladder catheter etc)
- Causes HTN emergency due to lack of inhibitory reflexes below injury and bradycardia
- Tx: Deepen anesthetic or use rapid acting vasodilators
- GA and spinal best anesthetic choice

## Bicarbonate

![bicarb](/assets/img/bicarb.png)

- Hyperosmolar, hypervolemia, hypernatremia, together cause inc ICP
- Left shift from bicarb on oxyhgb curve lasts up to 8 hrs dec PaO2
- Dec ionized calcium
    - Need to replace calcium with bicarb admin

- Administer Bicarbonate only in nongap acidosis such as renal tube acidosis, hyperk, diarrhea, enterocutaneous fistula. Consider bicarb in lactic acidosis if ph< 7.1 Minimal research to back this up. Rta type 1 is related to Ehler danlos, uti, sickle. RTA type 2 with rickets. RTA type 4  seen with urinary obstruction, immunosuppressants, kidney rejection. Also seen with many meds like diuretics and ace. Symptoms are high potassium and low bicarb.

- Probably not beneficial in cardiac surgery
- Bicarb is not shown to dec PVR, improve response to pressors, or inc CO

## Cerebral Blood Flow

![cerebral blood flow](/assets/img/cerebral.png)

## CO2 Curve

![co2 curve](/assets/img/co2curve.png)

### Bohr Effect

- CO2 and decreased pH cause erythrocytes to release O2
  
### Haldane Effect

- O2 causes the erythrocyte to release CO2

## Coagulation Cascade

![coagulation cascade](/assets/img/coag.png)

## Electrolye Review

### Calcium

- Parathyroid Hormone
	- Inc Ca release from bones (osteoclast)
	- Inc renal reabsorption
	- Inc Vit D3 activation (VitD comes from skin and is made into D3 in liver and activated in kidney)
	- Inc Ca reabsorption in intestines
- Calcitonin 
	- Dec Ca release from bones
- Bisphosphonates 
	- Treatment for hypercalcemia
- Secondary hyperPTH
	- Caused by decreased kidney function and or decreased Vit D3

### Potassium

- Shift into Cell:
	- Insulin (Na/K/ATPase)
	- Aldosterone (Conn syndrome causes hypokalemia)
	- Beta Agonist
	- Alkalosis
	
- Shift Out
	- Dec Insulin (DM)
	- Addisons (Dec aldosterone)
	- Beta Blockade
	- Acidosis (Dec fx of Na/K/ATPase)
	- Exercise (cell lysis)

## Heart Failure Review

### Diastolic

- Preserved EF
- Pressure work
- Hypertrophy
- Want nl preload, nsr, and dec afterload to help dec tissue remodel
- Give beta and calcium channel blockers
- Norepi for pressor

### Systolic

- Dec EF
- Volume work
- Dilated
- Want nl preload, nsr, and dec afterload  due to weak ventricle
- Give inotropes and vasodilators

## High Altitude Physiology Review

- Cerebral edema: hypoxia and vascular dilation
- Pulmonary edema: hypoxia causes vasoconstriction which inc capillary pressure: right heart failure eventually

- Tx with Acetazolamide to acidify the blood and inc ventilation (Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor) 
- Nifedipine to stop vasoconstriction in lungs

## Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome

- Dopamine Antagonist (1-3 days)
- Very inc temp, drooling, palor, coma, dec reflex, unstable autonomic nervous system (inc/dec BP/HR)
- Tx: Stop dopamine antagonist, give dopamine agonist (Bromocriptine, amantadine), IV fluid, cooling, benzos for agitation, Dantrolene for muscle relaxation
  
## Oxyhemoglobin Dissociation Curve

## Pain

### Pain Pathway

1. Tranduction: injury causes activation of fast A-Delta and slow C fibers. Substance P is released
   - Target Drugs: Local Anesthetic Cream, NSAIDs, Opioids
2. Transmission: Signals travel towards the brain via the spinothalamic tract
   - Target Drugs: Local Anesthetic blockade
3. Modulation: Within the substantia gelatinosa of the spinal cord
   1. Inhibition via the descending inhibitory pathway: 5HT and NE, effect inc with  antidepressants
   2. Augmentation via central sensitization and wind up: Blocked by ketamine and precedex
   3. Secondary Hyperalgesia: Inc substance P, triple response of dilation, erythema, wheal
   4. Primary Hyperalgesia: PGE2 stimulates free nerve endings
      1. NSAIDs and Steroids block PGE2
      2. Tylenol may antagonise cannabinoid receptors or a possible COX 3
   - Target Drugs:  NMDA anatagonists, Neruaxial Opioids, Alpha-2 Agonists, SNRIs
4. Perception
   - Target Drugs: General Anesthetics, Opioids, Alpha-2 Agonists

### Opiates

- Mu1: classic opiate effects
- Mu2 dependence, spinal analgesia
- Mu3 Immunosuppression
- Kappa: Dysphoria, hallucination, Antishiver
- Delta: Itching

## Renal Review

### AKI

1. Prerenal :
   1. Dec blood flow/oxygen  d/t dec volume
   2. Burns
   3. Vomit 
   4. Sepsis 
   5. Renal artery stenosis/thrombosis
2. Intrarenal :
   1. Glomerulonephritis
   2. HTN
   3. Pylo
   4. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ischemic, or medication/toxin)
3. Post Renal
   1. Stones/obstruction

### CKD

List of signs/symptoms:  
  
Uremia, azotemia (inc nitrogen), edema, ascites, anemia (d/t dec erythropoietin), osteomalacia (dec vit D activation and inc phosphate retention)

### Nephrotic Syndrome

- Loss of proteins across kidney tubules: from chronic glomerulonephritis, amyloidosis
- Causes dec osmotic pressure and profound edema

## Respiratory Tests/Spirometry

### Closing Volume

- Volume at which dynamic airway compression occurs
- Inc with age, obstructive disease, obesity, preggo
  
### Closing Capacity

- Closing Volume + Residual Volume
- Normally in spontaneously ventilating pts FRC > CC so airways do not collapse
- If FRC < CC airways collapse during normal tidal breathing leading to dec O2 sat, inc shunt
  - Tx with peep
  
### Residual Volume

- Not measured in spirometry
- Increased in obstructive disease
- Decreased in restrictive disease
  
### Total Lung Capacity

- Increased or normal in obstructive disease

### Interpreting PFTs

![pft](/assets/img/spirometry.png)

## Serotonin Syndrome

### Signs/Symptoms

- Inc temp, inc reflex, drooling, coma, agitated, sweating

### Causes

- SSRI/SNRI especially with MAOI
- Inc risk with: linezolid, methylene blue, lithium, fentanyl, stimulants like amphetamine, cipro, Erythromycin

### Treatment

- Cooling, IV fluids, paralysis/vent if temp uncontrolled 41C<, cyproheptadine, benzos

## Thyroid Review

- TRH -- TSH -- T4 -- T3 (activated T4-T3 in cells)
	- Levothyroxine (T4)
- Hyperthyroid Tx: Methimazole, Propylthiouracil (stops T4-T3), No amiodarone due Iodine
- Thyroid Storm: Propranolol is best beta blocker (stops T4-T3) and PTU
